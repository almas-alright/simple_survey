<p><strong>Low-range Thought Leader and Low-range Inspired Leader</strong></p>
<p><strong> Congratulations on completing the assessment! Let me take a moment to explain how the qualities of thought leadership and inspired leadership work together.</strong></p>
<p>As you are aware, it is extremely valuable to be a thought leader in today’s marketplace because it means you have two highly marketable skills: 1. You are a “futurist”—able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. you are a “visionary”— from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas! </p>
<p>Now, that said, a good idea will go nowhere if a leader is unable to influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm.  Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new.</p>
<p>Your score indicates that you may be uncomfortable with untraditional ideas, or have a hard time escaping your left-brain sensibilities to think outside the box. It also indicates that you may have fear of offending others, or being criticized, and so pointing out blind spots or outdated methodologies does not come naturally for you. But to make a dent in the universe, you want to improve these qualities. You want to get more comfortable with untraditional ideas and feel more at ease thinking outside-the-box.</p>
<p>It is my deep, fervent wish for you that you give yourself permission to unleash your inhibitions much more! It will not only give you more freedom, as well as confidence because you will have the courage to believe in something risky--but it will make you a much better thought leader, able to speak your mind, unafraid of confrontation or criticism. I also recommend that you put yourself into creative environments such as idea labs, where others can help you stimulate new thinking, as well as tap into environments that are different for you. A thought leader is deeply inquisitive, and well-informed on many subjects (that’s how they can see what’s missing.) Broaden your comfort zones—but also dive more deeply into your preferred subject and ask yourself, “What myths are those in my field still accepting?” And seek to break them!</p>
<p>Your score also indicates that you struggle to empower others. This is not unusual. In my practice, I have found inspirational leadership to be much more challenging for people than thought leadership. Our culture heavily rewards logical, empirical and intellectual interaction—in all professional domains—and there has been no strong role-modeling for inspired leadership, except in the case of a few rare, high-profile individuals. It is my experience that inspired leadership truly is innate, but it can be “unleashed”! This capacity is within us all, if we open our hearts. </p>
<p>Since you scored in the low range for inspired leadership, my recommendation is that you begin to alter your approach with others. As I have said, it is the inspired leader who effectively influences. This is a critically important skill as a leader. I believe it is the most important because we have to influence every day, all day long. If you are in business, it is a non-negotiable. You must be a strong, inspirational leader.</p>
<p>Here are some exercises that can begin to unleash the inspired leader in you: Become conscious of what you want for others. Ask yourself throughout a day, “What do I really want for my mate?” Or for my best friend? My co-worker? My clients? My target market, if I’m entrepreneurial? Then ask, “What unique qualities does each have that I can acknowledge?” Then, start telling them these things! An inspired leader feels compelled to empower. I know it’s in you. Give it a test-run this week!</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with me about ways to strengthen your inspirational leadership and package your thought-leader ideas into something marketable and meaningful, I would love to meet you! I work to develop leaders into this very careful and important combination of both thought and inspired leader, and a conversation with me could be very enlightening and even life-changing. I dare you to try something different! We will review your results and look together to see what is possible for your future!
