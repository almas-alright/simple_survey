<p><strong>Mid-range Thought Leader and Mid-range Inspired Leader</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations on completing the assessment! You have scored as both a competent thought leader and inspired leader--with an opportunity to strengthen your abilities with each. </p>
<p>As you are aware, it is extremely valuable to be a thought leader in today’s marketplace because it means you have two highly marketable skills: 1. You are a “futurist”—able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. you are a “visionary”— from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas! </p>
<p>Your score indicates that you can generate new ideas, forecast the future and feel strongly enough about your convictions to speak about them, It also indicates that you may have a fear of offending others or being criticized, and so pointing out blind spots and outdated methodologies does not come naturally for you. But to make a dent in the universe, you want to improve these qualities. You want to get more comfortable with untraditional ideas and feel more at ease thinking outside-the-box. </p>
<p>It is my wish for you that you unleash your inhibitions even more! It will not only give you more freedom, as well as confidence because you will have the courage to believe in something risky--but it will make you a much better thought leader, able to speak your mind, unafraid of confrontation or criticism. I also recommend that you put yourself into creative environments such as idea labs, where others can help you stimulate new thinking, as well as tap into environments that are different for you. A thought leader is deeply inquisitive, and well-informed on many subjects (that’s how they can see what’s missing.) Broaden your comfort zones—but also dive more deeply into your preferred subject and ask yourself, “What myths are those in my field still accepting?” And seek to break them!</p>
<p>Now, that said, a new thought will go nowhere if a leader is unable to influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm.  Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new.</p>
<p>Your score indicates that you could stretch yourself to call people even more effectively into their greatness. In my practice, I have found inspirational leadership to be much more challenging for people than thought leadership. Our culture heavily rewards logical, empirical and intellectual interaction—in all professional domains—and there has been no strong role-modeling for inspired leadership, except in the case of a few rare, high-profile individuals. It is my experience that inspired leadership truly is innate, but it can be “unleashed”! This capacity is within us all, if we open our hearts.</p>
<p>Since you scored in the average range for inspired leadership, my recommendation is that you begin to alter your approach with others. As I have said, it is the inspired leader who effectively influences. This is a critically important skill as a leader. I believe it is the most critical because we have to influence every day, all day long. If you are in business, it is essential.</p>
<p>To start, become conscious of what you want for others. Ask yourself throughout a day, “What do I really want for my mate?” Or for my best friend? My co-worker? My clients? My target market, if I’m entrepreneurial? Then ask, “What unique qualities does each have that I can acknowledge?” Then, start telling them these things! An inspired leader feels compelled to empower. I know it’s in you. Give it a test-run this week!</p>
<p>If you would you like to speak with me about strengthening these two vital traits of persuasive leadership, I would love to meet you! I work to build leaders into this very careful and important combination of both thought and inspired leader, and a conversation with me could be very enlightening and even life-changing. We will review your results and look together to see what is possible for your future.
