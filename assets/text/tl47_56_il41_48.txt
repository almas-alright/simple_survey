<p><strong>High Inspired Leader and High Thought Leader:</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have scored high as both an innately strong Inspired Leader and Thought Leader. Now, what does this really mean? As you are aware, it is extremely valuable to be a thought leader in today’s marketplace because it means you have two highly marketable skills: 1. You are a “futurist”—you are able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. you are a “visionary”— from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas! </p>
<p>Now, that said, a good idea will go nowhere if a leader is unable to influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm. Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new. </p>
<p>Your score indicates that you are naturally strong at both: seeing the future so you can invent the future, and inspiring your audiences to step into that future. You are instinctively able to spot what is new, invent new solutions--and you don’t care much if people criticize your ideas as long as you’re changing the status quo. That alone is worth gold! As an Inspired Leader, you do care a great deal about people; you believe they can achieve great things, and you’re also extremely passionate about your convictions.</p>
<p>So, congratulations are certainly in order! It is rare to be good at both the intellectual and emotional sides of persuasive leadership!</p>
<p>Here are some other important questions to ask yourself is: Have I formulated my ideas into a powerful message and package? If Lizabeth asked me what my key thought leader argument is, could I answer? If I were asked to influence someone right now to try my idea, would I know just how to frame my language to get a yes? If I want to sell my new idea, could I describe right now what it is that I sell? And am I sure it is marketable? </p>
<p>These are tough questions and even if you feel you would answer them powerfully, I believe you would get immense value from a discourse with me on your ideas. I work privately with subject matter experts in a program called The Powerhouse Method. Why don’t you click here to be directed to a page that describes my process and offers you a chance to speak with me directly by phone. I would LOVE to meet you! I guarantee an enlightening conversation, at the very least, and a chance to become truly one-of-a-kind in your field. It’s worth a look!</p>
