<p><strong>High-Range Thought Leader and Low-Range Inspired Leader</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have scored as a very strong, natural, thought leader, and as an inspired leader with an opportunity to shift your approach with people.</p>
<p>As you are aware, it is extremely valuable to be a thought leader in today’s marketplace because it means you have two highly marketable skills: 1. You are a “futurist”—able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. you are a “visionary”— from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas. </p>
<p>Now, that said, a good idea will go nowhere if a leader is unable to influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm.  Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new.</p>
<p>Your score indicates that you are naturally strong as a thought leader—so congratulations are certainly in order! It also indicates that you struggle to call people into their greatness. This is not unusual. In my practice, I have found inspirational leadership to be much more challenging for people than thought leadership. Our culture heavily rewards logical, empirical and intellectual interaction—in all professional domains—and there has been no strong role-modeling for inspired leadership, except in the case of a few rare, high-profile individuals. It is my experience that inspired leadership truly is innate and can’t be taught…but it can be “unleashed”! This capacity is within us all, if we open our hearts. Since you scored in the low range for inspired leadership, my recommendation is that you begin to alter your approach with others. As I have said, it is the inspired leader who effectively influences. This is a critically important skill as a leader. I believe it is the most critical because we have to influence every day, all day long.</p>
<p>Here are some exercises that can begin to unleash the inspired leader in you: Become conscious of what you want for others. Ask yourself throughout a day, “What do I really want for my mate?” Or for my best friend? My co-worker? My clients? My target market, if I’m entrepreneurial? Then ask, “What unique qualities does each have that I can acknowledge?” Then, start telling them these things! An inspired leader feels compelled to empower. I know it’s in you. Give it a test-run this week!</p>
<p>You scored high in thought leadership, but the next vital question to ask yourself is: Have I formulated my ideas into a powerful message and package? If Lizabeth asked me what my key thought leader argument is, could I answer? If I want to sell my new idea, could I describe right now what it is that I sell? And am I sure it is marketable? </p>
<p>If you would like to speak with me about ways to strengthen your inspirational leadership and package your thought-leader ideas into something marketable and meaningful, I would love to meet you! I work to develop leaders into this very careful and important combination of both thought and inspired leader, and a conversation with me could be very enlightening and even life-changing. Since you’re a strong thought leader, it will be second-nature for you to dare and try something different! We will review your results and look together to see what is possible for your future.
