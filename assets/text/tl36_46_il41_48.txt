<p><strong>High Inspired Leader and Mid-Range Thought Leader:</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have scored as a very strong, natural, inspired leader, and as a thought leader with some wonderfully strong tendencies, but room for improvement.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how these two qualities work together. A thought leader is very desirable in today’s marketplace because such a leader embodies two highly marketable skills: 1. As a “futurist” they are able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. as a “visionary” they are, from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas! </p>
<p>As stated, you scored very high as an Inspired Leader. This is extremely promising because it means that once you have the courage or have the new idea, you can naturally influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm. Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new. Your score indicates that you are naturally strong at inspiring others to change, and of the two types of leaders, I consider the inspired leader the most powerful. You can move people to action! So, congratulations are certainly in order!</p>
<p>As a thought leader, your score indicates that you are strong in some areas of innovative thinking, seeing blind spots and stepping out of the mainstream, but none of those tendencies comes entirely naturally for you. I recommend that you spend more time in creative environments such as idea labs, where others can help you stimulate new thinking, as well as tap into environments that are different for you. A thought leader is deeply inquisitive, and well-informed on many subjects (that’s how they can see what’s missing.) Broaden your comfort zones—but also dive more deeply into your preferred subject and ask yourself, “What myths are those in my field still accepting?” And seek to break them! </p>
<p>It is also my wish for you that you unleash your inhibitions much more! It will not only give you so much more freedom, as well as confidence because you will have the courage to believe in something risky--but it will make you a much better thought leader, able to speak your mind, unafraid of confrontation or criticism.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with me about ways to strengthen your thought leadership and implement your ability as an inspired leader, I would love to meet you! I work to develop leaders into this very careful and important combination of both thought and inspired leader, and a conversation with me could be very enlightening and even life-changing.
