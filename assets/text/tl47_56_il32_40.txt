<p><strong>High-Range Thought Leader and Mid-Range Inspired Leader :</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have scored as a very strong, natural, thought leader, and as an inspired leader with some wonderfully strong tendencies, but room for growth as an influencer. </p>
<p>As you are aware, it is extremely valuable to be a thought leader in today’s marketplace because it means you have two highly marketable skills: 1. You are a “futurist”—able to see how current trends will unfold into future trends at least five years down the line, and 2. you are a “visionary”— from that data, able to imagine new landscapes different from any that currently exist. This is what the future success of all working people will soon be predicated upon: the ability to be creative; to generate wholly new ideas! </p>
<p>Now, that said, a good idea will go nowhere if a leader is unable to influence those still conforming to old ways to let go of them and step into the new paradigm.  Influencing others requires articulating a strong argument and inspiring them to dare to leave the old; inspiring them, in fact, to want nothing but the new.</p>
<p>Your score indicates that you are naturally strong as a thought leader—so congratulations are certainly in order! It also indicates that you could stretch within yourself to call people even more effectively into their greatness. In my practice, I have found inspirational leadership to be much more challenging for people than thought leadership. Our culture heavily rewards logical, empirical and intellectual interaction—in all professional domains—and there has been no strong role-modeling for inspired leadership, except in the case of a few rare, high-profile individuals. </p>
<p>Since you scored in the average range for inspired leadership, my recommendation is that you begin to alter your approach with others. As I have said, it is the inspired leader who effectively influences. This is a critically important skill as a leader. I believe it is the most critical because we have to influence every day, all day long. If you are in business, it is essential.</p>
<p>So, begin by becoming conscious of what you want for others. Ask yourself throughout a day, “What do I really want for my mate?” Or for my best friend? My co-worker? My clients? My target market, if I’m entrepreneurial? Then ask, “What unique qualities does each have that I can acknowledge?” Then, start telling them these things! An inspired leader feels compelled to empower. I know it’s in you. Give it a test-run this week!</p>
